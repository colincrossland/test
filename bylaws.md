Structure and Procedures of the Tampa Bid for FCYPAA

(The term “Bid” will represent “Tampa Bid for FCYPAA” throughout the entirety of this document.)


Purpose
The Bid is a group of Alcoholics Anonymous members, which meets in the city of Tampa and surrounding areas, and desires to carry the message of Alcoholics Anonymous through the process of bidding for and hosting the Florida Conference of Young People in Alcoholics Anonymous (FCYPAA).
The Bid strives to provide an opportunity to enthusiastically carry A.A.’s message to young alcoholics throughout the city of Tampa.
The Bid strives to practice AAs three legacies of Recovery, Unity and Service in all it does.
The Bid works to prepare Alcoholics Anonymous groups and service bodies to include young people.
The Bid provides an opportunity for fellowship and fun among young people in the city of Tampa – we are NOT a glum lot.
The Bid prepares and presents a bid book at each FCYPAA that meets all FCYPAA Bidding Requirements.

Membership
Membership in the Bid consists of members-at-large and members holding elected positions on the Bid.
Members holding elected positions are those members that have been elected to a position defined in Section 11 of this document:
If an elected member misses 2 consecutive meetings, the Chair or Co-Chair will reach out to the elected member and explain that if the member does not either 1.) Show up to the next meeting, or 2.) Send a report, excusing their absence, the elected member will be automatically removed from their position.
It is expected that members who serve under elected positions will fulfill the duties of their position and regularly attend meetings of the Bid.
All members holding elected positions are expected to notify the chair 24 hours before if they are unable to attend a meeting of the Bid.
The Chair of the Bid will notify any position holder not fulfilling position requirements verbally, if the situation is not rectified immediately, it will be brought to the committee by the chair.
Any elected member may be removed from their position by a 2/3 vote.
Immediately following the removal or resignation of any individual holding an elected position, the co-chair will assume the duties of that position, when a co-chair is available, until the next face to face committee meeting. At this meeting an election will occur for that elected position.
Relapse; as the term understood in Alcoholics Anonymous, shall be considered an automatic resignation of any elected position.
Any elected member of the Bid removed under provisions in this section will still be considered a Member-At-Large of the Tampa Bid.
Members-at-Large are those members who have stated their desire to be members of the Bid by placing their name on the official roster maintained by the Secretary of the Bid and have either a) attended a minimum of one subcommittee meeting or b) attended one full business meeting of the Bid.

Subcommittees
Subcommittees
Subcommittees serve to facilitate specific tasks pertinent to the committee’s general operation.
Subcommittees are responsible for brainstorming, planning and executing duties associated with their respected position. They meet regularly to discuss matters pertinent to their particular functions within the scope of the committee.
Subcommittee chairs may create positions within said subcommittee and appoint a committee member to that position without requiring an election.
While subcommittees meet regularly, any member of the at-large committee who has been elected to a chair position may hold a meeting to discuss topics relevant to their function at a given time.
Subcommittee Meetings should follow the same operating procedures as the General Bid Meetings.
Subcommittees meet following the meeting format and a written agenda provided by the chair of subcommittee and must not conflict with regular scheduled business meeting.
Written agendas are essential to meeting effectively and efficiently.
Must record minutes of meeting for archives. Either appoint a secretary or record your own minutes.
Any members who are responsible for submitting a report to the secretary must do so two days before the committee business meeting, unless otherwise specified by a group conscience. Written reports are brought to Secretary at every business meeting for archives.

Subcommittee meetings should be scheduled with care given to the time, day, and location, as well as other scheduled subcommittee meetings so those interested can attend.
If Subcommittee Meeting is being held at an AA Clubhouse or other AA-sponsored public location, the 7th Tradition basket shall be passed around.
Notification of subcommittee meetings must be made to the entire Bid by email no less than 3 days prior to the scheduled meeting.
Should a subcommittee need to meet in the event of an emergency, the chair of the subcommittee may call a meeting as necessary provided the chair has presented the need for an emergency meeting to the Chair and the Co-Chair of the Bid and obtained their agreement that an emergency meeting is necessary.
The Bid has the following subcommittees;
